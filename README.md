# Braina: Brain Interaction Analysis

This project is dedicated to the analysis of complex neural interactions using a combination of powerful toolboxes: `frites`, `hoi`, and `xgi`. It serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and students interested in applying information-theoretical measures to electrophysiological data.

## Getting Started

To interact with this project and its associated notebooks and scripts, you will need to have the `gemini-cli` installed.

### Installing gemini-cli

You can find the latest installation instructions for `gemini-cli` in the official documentation:

*   [https://github.com/google/gemini-cli](https://github.com/google/gemini-cli)

```

### Papers

The `papers/` directory contains a collection of key research papers that form the theoretical foundation of the analysis techniques used in this project.

### Tutorials

The `tutorials/` directory provides practical examples and hands-on tutorials to guide you through the process of analyzing neural data.

*   **`multivariate_information_theory_frites_hoi_xgi/`**: This tutorial focuses on the integration of `frites`, `hoi`, and `xgi` for performing multivariate information theory analysis.
*   **`seeg_ebrains_frites/`**: This tutorial demonstrates how to use the `frites` toolbox to analyze SEEG data, with examples from the ebrains platform.
