    "## Building the Mathematical Groundwork for Understanding Multivariate Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first notebook in our series on multivariate information theory! In this notebook, we'll build the fundamental concepts from the ground up. Think of this as laying the foundation of a house—we need solid basics before we can construct more complex structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll understand:\n",
    "1. What entropy really measures (and why it's not just \"randomness\")\n",
    "2. How to compute entropy for discrete and continuous variables\n",
    "3. Joint entropy and conditional entropy\n",
    "4. Mutual information as a measure of dependence\n",
    "5. Conditional mutual information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Start From Scratch?\n",
    "\n",
    "While we'll eventually use powerful packages like HOI, Frites, and XGI, implementing these concepts ourselves first provides crucial intuition. When the more advanced measures give surprising results later (like negative interaction information!), you'll understand why.\n",

    "## Part 1: Understanding Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Intuition Behind Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy measures **uncertainty** or **surprise**. Think about these scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario A**: You flip a fair coin. Before observing, you're maximally uncertain about the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario B**: You flip a heavily biased coin that lands heads 99% of the time. You're pretty sure it'll be heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario A has **higher entropy** because the outcome is more uncertain. This is the core idea: entropy quantifies how much we don't know.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Mathematical Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "For a discrete random variable $X$ with possible values $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H(X) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i) \\log_2 P(x_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\log_2$ means we measure entropy in **bits**. One bit is the information gained from one fair coin flip.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the Negative Sign?\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilities are between 0 and 1, so $\\log_2(P(x_i))$ is negative. The negative sign makes entropy positive, which matches our intuition that \"uncertainty\" should be a positive quantity."
